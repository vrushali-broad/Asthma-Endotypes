This folder explains construction of immune network and generates the network in Figure 1(b) and attractors in Figure S4.

# Example data

We provide a test dataset (.gpml) from WikiPathways [Pathway:WP554](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP554) under RUDRA_code/example_data.

## Run test

To generate a rule set from the test GPML file, run
```
bash run_test.sh
```
The output network is given in example_output.
This file also generates the network in Figure 1(b) as paper_network.
